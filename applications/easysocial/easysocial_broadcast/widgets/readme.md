## Application Widgets
Application widgets are small block of codes that would be displayed on a `widget view`. Widgets are something similar to modules on a Joomla site but it can only be placed on certain areas on the site. 

Example of widgets: 

* A calendar that appears on a person's profile.
* A clock that appears on the person's dashboard.
* A list of to-do items that appears on the person's dashboard.
* A list of cook books the user created.
* A list of reviews the user has made that appears on their profile.

`dashboard` - This is the dashboard view for the current logged in user.

`profile` - This is the profile view where others view another person's profile
